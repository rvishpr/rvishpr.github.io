      <description>Overview Not many who have left school use concepts such as Dynamic Programming on a day to day basis, only to come to them when preparing for an interview. However, it helps to understand these concepts, not because one may use them everyday, but they help look at old problems in new ways, hence helping find better solutions to even mundane problems one may face at work. This post should provide an introduction to Dynamic Programming and after reading this, it should be possible to attempt the problems provided at the end with ease.</description>

      <description>Load balancing at its simplest is defined as distributing load across a group of servers, so they appear to the clients/users as one big server. Load balancing does more than simply distribute load. It helps with redundancy. It helps with scaling the service provided, without the users having to know about it. And more. Iâ€™ll attempt to capture some of it here. This can serve as an overview to load balancing.</description>
